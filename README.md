# 📩 Spam Message Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a spam detection system using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to classify text messages as either **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on their content.

The model is trained on labeled message data and applies text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to achieve accurate predictions.


## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load and explore spam message datasets
2. Clean and preprocess text data
3. Convert text into numerical features
4. Train a supervised machine learning classifier
5. Evaluate model performance


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Spam_Message_Detection_NLP.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Make sure required libraries are installed
4. Run all cells

## 🎯 Outcome
The model successfully classifies messages as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.
